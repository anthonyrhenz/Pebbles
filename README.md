# Pebbles
Plays Pebbles, a game designed to teach threading to second years at the University of Exeter.

<h2>Description</h2>
Threads race towards an improbable condition - randomly taking pebbles of given weights from 3 pairs of bags, hoping that a hand of 10 pebbles have a total weight of 100.<br>
The game is not turn based; instead players are to be threaded and take pebbles as quickly as possible.<br>
If another player is taking from a bag, other players may not access it. Actions must be performed atomically.<br>

This program was written with the pair programming paradigm in order to reduce errors and develop more efficiently.<br>
